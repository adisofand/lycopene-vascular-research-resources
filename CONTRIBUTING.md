# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this curated resource collection! The goal is to build a comprehensive, high-quality hub for open-source tools, datasets, and literature related to lycopene's effects on vascular health.

## How to Suggest a New Resource

1. **Open an Issue**  
   - Use the issue template (if available) or create a new issue with the label `resource-suggestion`.
   - Include a brief description of the resource, its relevance to lycopene/vascular research, and a link (GitHub repository, dataset page, etc.).

2. **Submit a Pull Request**  
   - Fork the repository, create a new branch, and edit the appropriate section of `README.md` (or add a new file if needed).
   - Follow the existing formatting: provide a clear title, link, and a one‑sentence description.
   - Ensure the resource is publicly available and has a clear open‑source license.

## Quality Criteria

- **Relevance**: The resource should directly support research on lycopene, cardiovascular/vascular function, antioxidant intake, dietary data processing, endothelial function analysis, or related methodologies.
- **Open‑Source**: Preferably hosted on GitHub (or another public platform) with an explicit open‑source license.
- **Documentation**: The resource should have enough documentation to be usable by other researchers.

## Questions?

If you are unsure whether a resource fits the scope, feel free to open an issue with the `question` label and describe the resource. The maintainers will gladly discuss it with you.
